	THANKS

Aphra - Thank you, a thousand times. Without you, this mod wouldn't have been possible. 

HotA Crew - for the incredible HotA mod. This patch was created out of love for your work.  I'm particularly grateful for your inclusion of so many elements of Pumpkin patch 1.3.x into HotA 1.7.2 - seeing my work appear as the official Horn of the Abyss was exhilarating.  I also want to thank you for adding Murdoch, my favourite hero, to the campaign "All In", and for the recognition you've shown for the Pumpkin Patch through those means. 

The Wiki team - for their amazing work

BTB, void_17 - thanks for the help with some tricky hex editing!

The Pumpkin Patch community - for the ideas and suggestions. Takling with you drives me to make this mod.
